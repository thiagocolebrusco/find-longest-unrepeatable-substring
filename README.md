# Find Longest Unrepeatable Substring - Coding Challenge
Source code from a challenge that, given a string, it needs to find the length of the longest consecutive substring without repeating characters.

Examples:
- Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
- Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
- Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
